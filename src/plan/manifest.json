    "summary": "Added 'node-fetch' import to ensure fetch is available in Node.js environments. The implementation now uses a real API call to DuckDuckGo's search endpoint instead of mock logic. Input validation, error handling, and environment variable checks are preserved for production readiness.",
    "next_steps": [
      "Add support for additional search engines or APIs as fallback options.",
      "Implement caching for search results to reduce API calls.",
      "Add logging for debugging and monitoring purposes."
