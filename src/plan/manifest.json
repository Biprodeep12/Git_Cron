    "summary": "The `webSearch` module now contains a clean, well‑documented mock search function. It validates non‑empty queries, optionally accepts a `limit` flag (currently unused but preserved for future use), simulates async delay, and returns a deterministic string. A small helper `_void()` keeps the unused `limit` variable silent without affecting type safety. The code is fully typed, documented, and ready for integration.",
    "next_steps": [
      "Run the project’s test suite to confirm no regressions.",
      "If a linting rule flags the `_void` helper or the unused `limit` variable, either remove the helper and use a comment directive (e.g., `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`) or keep the helper as shown.",
      "When the real `limit` feature is needed, replace the placeholder usage of `_void(limit)` with actual logic that respects the `limit` value."
