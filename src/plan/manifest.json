    "summary": "The mock `webSearch` implementation has been slightly refined for clarity and future extensibility. Added a detailed example in the JSDoc, preserved the unused `limit` option with an explicit comment, and kept the `_void` helper to silence unused-variable warnings. Overall functionality remains identical, but the file is now better documented and prepared for upcoming feature expansions.",
    "next_steps": "1. Run the project's test suite to ensure the changes do not break any tests.\n2. If linting rules disallow the unused parameter helper, replace `_void(limit)` with an appropriate comment or Lint directive.\n3. Implement the `limit` feature in the future if required, removing the placeholder comments and helper.",
