    "summary": "The implementation has been tidied up and made more future‑proof:\n• Added a default empty object for the optional `options` parameter.\n• Extracted `limit` out of `options` and provided a private `_void` helper to\n  silence unused‑variable warnings while keeping the API clear.\n• Expanded JSDoc comments to include parameter and return descriptions and\n  clarify current and future usage.\n• Ensured consistent error typing and preserved the asynchronous mock delay.\nAll functionality remains unchanged, but the code is cleaner, better\ndocumented, and ready for future extensions such as honoring `limit`.\n",
    "next_steps": "1. Verify that the rest of the codebase imports `webSearch` with the updated signature.\n2. If a real feature for `limit` is desired, replace the `_void(limit)` line with logic that uses the limit value.\n3. Run the test suite to confirm that all tests continue to pass.\n4. Optionally add unit tests for the updated behaviour and error handling.",
