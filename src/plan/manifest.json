    "summary": "The `webSearch` module validates non‑empty queries, optionally accepts a `limit` flag, simulates an async delay, and returns a deterministic string. The helper `_void` silences the unused `limit` variable, preserving type safety. All core functionality remains unchanged while extraneous comments have been removed.",
    "next_steps": [
      "Run the project’s test suite to confirm no regressions.",
      "If a linting rule flags the `_void` helper or the unused `limit` variable, either remove the helper and use an eslint-disable comment, or keep the helper as shown.",
      "When the real `limit` feature is needed, replace the placeholder usage of `_void(limit)` with actual logic that respects the `limit` value."
