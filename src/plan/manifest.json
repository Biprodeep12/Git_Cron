    "summary": "The `webSearch` module validates non‑empty queries, optionally accepts a `limit` flag (currently unused but retained for future expansion), simulates an asynchronous delay, and returns a deterministic string. The helper `_void` is used to silence the unused `limit` variable without affecting type safety, while documentation is kept concise.",
    "next_steps": [
      "Run the project’s test suite to confirm no regressions.",
      "If a linting rule flags the `_void` helper or the unused `limit` variable, either remove the helper and use an eslint-disable comment, or keep the helper as shown.",
      "When the real `limit` feature is needed, replace the placeholder usage of `_void(limit)` with actual logic that respects the `limit` value."
